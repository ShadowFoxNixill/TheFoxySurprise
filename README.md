# TheFoxySurprise
Discord bot for dice rolling

# Code coming soon!
I'm looking to release the source code and the bot's link soon. Check back! In the meantime, if you already have TheFoxySurprise on your server, the issue tracker is open for you. And for those of you who have the bot and want the code, I'll make a bot announcement when it's ready to be released to the world.

## But how do I use it?
Type `!help` in chat and you'll be linked to [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jj7l7qArbZXlWQZKbFhT8abk1lCCMfvl1LuJVPfpQOo/edit) explaining everything you need to know about it.

## How do I get bot announcements!
A server admin should type `@TheFoxySurprise !notify on` to subscribe that channel to the announcements. You can also subscribe in PM by typing the same thing in PM.
